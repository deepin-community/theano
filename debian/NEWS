theano (1.0.1+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Theano's primary developers are ending its development:
  they are currently providing maintenance only (not active development),
  and intend to also terminate this in late 2018.
  I intend to keep this package available for the time being, but
  it may eventually be necessary to remove it,
  e.g. if it does not work with future versions of its dependencies.
  See https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.02688.pdf section II.E for a
  discussion of alternatives; of these, Torch (but not its Python
  bindings) and Caffe are currently packaged in Debian.
