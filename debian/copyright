Comment: "Theano Development Team" was led by MILA (previously LISA lab, University of Montreal), but includes external contributors (see NEWS.txt and HISTORY.txt).  theano/tests/main.py is the file explicitly marked as "contains code adapted from NumPy", but doc/acknowledgement.txt suggests it is not the only part based on NumPy.
